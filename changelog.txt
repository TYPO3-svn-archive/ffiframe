- Frameborder parameter was set incorrectly, as default for an IFRAME is "frameborder=1", but the plugin assumed that it was "frameborder=0"
  Thanks to Stephan Bauer for reporting this bug.

- URLs are now parsed throu the typolink function, so now its possible to link to internal TYPO3 pages as well.

- Added check to test if the "src" URL is really on local domain, if the autoresize option is enabled.

- Added support for "longdesc" parameter.
